      <p>Hi, I love the color purple.The background color is one of my favorite shades. I also really like light blues and bright yellows!<p>
        <p>My dog's name is River! He is six years old and is a mix between a black labrador and a mountain cur.<p>
        <p>My favorite animal is a giraffe! I know it may seem far-fecthed (or impossible), but I would love to ride one some day! </p>
